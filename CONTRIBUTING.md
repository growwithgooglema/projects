## Instructions

To initiate a collaborative project, please do the following:

### Get started with Git and GitHub

- Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com) if you haven't already.
- Join the [Grow with Google - New England GitHub organization](https://github.com/growwithgooglema).
- Install Git
  - Mac:
    - Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
    - Install Git via Homebrew on the command line: `brew install git`
  - See the [Git Downloads page](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for more options.
  - *Why use Git?* It allows for maintenance of separate sets of the same code (branches), each with the ability to track and undo changes in high detail.
- Install the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) git client.
- Install Git extensions for your text editor:
  - [Atom](https://atom.io/): [Git and GitHub support](https://github.atom.io/) built-in.
  - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/): [GitSavvy](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/GitSavvy)
  - [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/): [Git support](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/versioncontrol) built in.
- Git and GitHub resources:
  - [Git docs](https://git-scm.com/)
  - [GitHub & Collaboration](https://www.udacity.com/course/github-collaboration--ud456) Udacity course
  - [Quick reference guide to Git and GitHub from @br3ndonland](https://github.com/br3ndonland/general/blob/master/guide-git.md)

### Fork, clone, and branch

- Fork the repository on GitHub. Forking creates a copy for your GitHub account.
- Clone the repository from the GitHub fork to your computer.
  - [GitHub Desktop can be used to clone](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/).
  - If cloning from the command line:

    ```bash
    cd <PATH-WHERE-YOU-WANT-THE-REPO>
    git clone git@github.com:growwithgooglema/projects.git
    ```

- Create a branch for your project.
  - Use a clear name for your branch. When submitting a pull request, the pull request name is auto-populated from the branch name.
  - Again, GitHub Desktop can be used for this.
  - Command line option:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b myspecialproject
    ```

  - The `checkout` command creates a branch and switches to the new branch.
  - The project can be further branched, for example onto a `dev` branch. The `dev` branch should be merged into the main project branch before pushing to GitHub.

### Suggest a project

- Create a markdown file and save with extension ".md".
  - Check out these resources if you are unfamiliar with Markdown:
    - [MarkdownGuide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
    - [GitHub-Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
    - [Markdown reference guide from @br3ndonland](https://github.com/br3ndonland/udacity-google/blob/master/markdown-guide.md)
- Add your project ideas and their specifications to the Markdown file and save.

### Commit and push

- After saving files, changes need to be committed to the Git repository.
  - GitHub Desktop provides a user interface to make this easy.
  - Command line commits:

    ```bash
    git add --all
    git commit -m "commit message"
    ```
- After committing, push the changes to your fork on GitHub.

#### Best practices for commits

- **Make meaningful, cohesive, focused commits.** Commit when an objective has been completed, or before a major change is made. Break changes up into topics so the maintainer can easily accept or reject changes from a pull request.
- **Include a commit message, with an imperative title.** See [How to make a Git commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

### Submit pull request

- A pull request asks the owner of the master repository to merge changes from the requester's fork to the master repository. See [About pull requests on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).
- Click "New pull request" on the master repository's GitHub page.
- Click "Compare across forks." The base fork is the location in the master repository where the changes will go. The head fork is your fork where the changes are located.

#### Best practices for pull requests

- **Create pull requests from topic branches.** Creating a branch for your project, and submitting the pull request from that branch, helps keep the master repository organized.
- **Provide a descriptive pull request message.**
  - List changes with bullet points.
  - Reference other pull requests that may be superseded by this request.

## Code style

### Markdown

- Please follow the suggestions for standardized Markdown formatting provided by [markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint) and [Markdown Style Guide](http://www.cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide/).
- Further suggestions:
  - Dashes for unordered lists
  - The first line of the file should be the title as H1, like `# Title`.
  - Include `## Table of Contents`, and use Markdown All in One in vscode to insert the ToC.

### Python

- Please format Python code for Python 3 and [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
- We amend PEP 8 to permit a line length of 100 characters.

### JavaScript

[JavaScript Semistandard Style](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard) (based on [JavaScript Standard Style](https://standardjs.com/), but retaining semicolons)
